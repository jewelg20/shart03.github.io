<p class="first">Band</p>

<sub>In seventh grade, I joined band because I didn't want to join the other classes and I didn't know that I would eventualy stay in it and make amazing memories. I joined marching band my freshman year and made even more friends and memories. I didn't plan to stay in band this long, but I did and I don't regret anything.</sub>

<sub>Since elementary school, I did volleyball until middle school when I <br>decided to join band. I have been in band for almost 5 years now and I am <br>glad that I stayed. I picked up crocheting around sixth grade when i saw <br>my sister-in-law do it. It is now a habit and a good stress-reliever to me <br>and I enjoy it a lot. I play a lot of video games and I play them quite often. <br> I have a lot of gaming consoles and I have a lot of old school ones as well, <br>such as a Nintendo 64(N64) or a GameCube </sub>
