<p class="first">Background</p>

<sub>Growing up in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, I moved a lot and even stayed in Georgia for sometime until I was five and stayed in Waipahu for two years. Afterwards, I moved to Ewa Beach in 2011 and have been staying here for almost nine years now. I am the youngest out of six kids and I am currently living with my mom and brother. </sub>

<div id="since">
<sub>Since elementary school, I did volleyball until middle school when I <br>decided to join band. I have been in band for almost 5 years now and I am <br>glad that I stayed. I picked up crocheting around sixth grade when i saw <br>my sister-in-law do it. It is now a habit and a good stress-reliever to me <br>and I enjoy it a lot. I play a lot of video games and I play them quite often. <br> I have a lot of gaming consoles and I have a lot of old school ones as well, <br>such as a Nintendo 64(N64) or a GameCube </sub>
